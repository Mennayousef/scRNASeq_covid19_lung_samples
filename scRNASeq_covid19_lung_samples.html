                        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                        This project aims to analyze scRNA-seq data to gain insights into the cellular and molecular changes associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory failure. By studying the lung tissue of individuals who died of COVID-19, we aim to understand the host response at the tissue level and uncover potential therapeutic targets.

                        <strong>Objective</strong><br>
                        The objective of this project is to analyze scRNA-seq data from the lungs of COVID-19 patients who experienced respiratory failure, in comparison with control individuals. By characterizing the cellular and molecular changes associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, we aim to identify key cell types, transcriptional states, and molecular pathways that contribute to the condition.

                        <strong>Dataset Description</strong><br>
                        The dataset used in this project consists of scRNA-seq data obtained from approximately 116,000 nuclei extracted from lung tissue samples of nineteen individuals who died of COVID-19 and underwent rapid autopsy. As a comparison, seven control individuals were also included.
